## Setup

Unzip the archive.
Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (University.java). Assume it's C:\.
Type 'javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption: The path variable is set).
Now, type ' java University ' to run your program.
You will be able to see the result printed on the window.

## Usage

This System is useful when it comes to organisational matters.
It is simpler and quicker to have everything saved in a database.
That is what this program is trying to achieve for University and its students.
Having all modules descriptors and grades all together is more efficient when navigating through information.
